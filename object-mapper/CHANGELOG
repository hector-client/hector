Changes by version:
===================

3.0-03
- Fixed issues with generics and JDK's prior to 1.6.0_25

3.0-02
- issue-402 : fix single collection instantiation
- issue-207 : added VariableIntegerConverter

2.0-02
======
- issue-310 : Collections Should Respect Converters
- issue-227 : BREAKS EXISTING CONVERTERS!!! changed Converter interface so convertCassTypeToObjType takes a PropertyMappingDefinition
- issue-246 : BREAKS EXISTING ANONYMOUS HANDLERS!!! changed anonymous property handling so the property value can be
              any type.  Also removed @Anonymous... method annotations in favor of a single
              @AnonymousPropertyHandling at class level
- BREAKS EXISTING EntityManager (possibly) : It implemented javax.persistence.EntityManager, which has been removed - none of
  the methods were implemented. deprecated save and load in favor of find and persist (because probably popular methods)
- added EntityManagerImpl.persist(Collection<Object> objColl) - the main advantage over persist(Object obj) is that
  a single batch mutation will be used for performance
- added better exception handling when entity does not have default constructor          
- fix bug: when mapping java collections, if property name different from column name, would not map correctly
- issue-326 : determineSerializer now uses SerializerTypeInferer from hector-core to pickup standard hector serializers


2.0-01
=======
- bumped version to 2.0-01 for cassandra 1.0 release, just in case any specific ties to cassandra 1.0
- fixing inheritance issues (Issue #256).  thx rrotmark
- updating to support Collection properties.  This is implemented by saving the list elements within same Cassandra row as POJO.
- cleanup pom
