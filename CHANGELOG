Added option to wait for schema agreements on cluster operations

Addressing issue 226 on gh where attempts to release on suspended pools will leak clients
Fixed issue with using BB serializer for BA serializer as pointed out by @bhuvan.rajt on ML
Wrapper api for op timers (makes current speed4j implementation plugable). The default logger is no a nulllogger, so op timing is off by default (sbridges)

Fix potential race condition in numBlocked if an exception was thrown creating a thrift client (sbridges)

0.8.0-1
=======
CQL queries available via CqlQuery

Reset to the results of adding the pool to the connection manager. This could cause a pretty ugly issue where the host would just disappear if there was a failure adding it back after the successful test.
Fixed retry logic in the case of fail after one more try configuration. Also modifies some long standing (and I believe incorrect) behaviour of trying until successful on a timeout exception.
Adding recommended default configuration string for dynamic comparator

Added option for setting keepalive on the underlying socket. Defaults to false.
Updated logger level to more appropriate warn in HConnectionManager.
Slight changes to use Cluster class and definitions already defined to check for new nodes.  Originally causing a problem when Cassandra security it turned on. Thanks to nneuberger1 for the patch.
Add ability to return a timestamp based on UUID.
Added HColumn timestamp signature changes from master. Thanks to Oleg Tsvinev for the patch.
Reset to the results of adding the pool to the connection manager. This could cause a pretty ugly issue where the host would just disappear if there was a failure adding it back after the successful test.
Fixed retry logic in the case of fail after one more try configuration. Also modifies some long standing (and I believe incorrect) behaviour of trying until successful on a timeout exception.

0.7.0-29
========
Huge contrib of template-method design pattern approach by David Cox. See m.p.c.service.template packageand testing coverage for such. Fans of SpringFramework's JdbcTemplate should give this a look (still work in progress though).

 here.

0.7.0-28
========
Rethrow on HUnavailableException since we cannot satisfy the requested CL and never will be able to (hence futility of retrying)
ExceptionTranslator did not correctly handle poolExhausted exceptionCleanup of NonBlockingHashMap semantics and extraneous string creation after profiling sessio
Added the jul-to-slf4j bridge for catching dumb jmx logger leak
Initial cut of HColumnFamily wrapper added. Comments welcome.
First pass at HostTimeoutTracker: when configured, if a node throws a TimeoutException N times within X interval, suspend connections to the host for Y seconds (all configurable via CassandraHostConfigurator). This feature has not b
een heavily tested and is here to gather feedback. Use at your own risk.
Cleanup of some logging level stuff to generate less-scary (or no) log messages under standard operating procedure.
HSlicePredicate exposes some additional convinience methods for easier use
Added JAXB serializers thanks to GH user shuzang
Cleanup of OrderedSuperRows thanks to GH user alexism

Mutator has easier row level deletion methods
Fix potential race condition in ConcurrentHClientPool with large number of threads. https://github.com/rantav/hector/issues#issue/136 (Thanks to @masseyke for the test case)
LeastActive policy updated to shuffle before selection. This spreads load out better among pools in low to moderate traffic environments (ie. when ConcurrentHClientPool#getNumActive are all equal). 
Fix NPE in checking that cassandraHostRetryService is turned when host is being marked down (thanks to ML poster Shimi for bug report)
A CassandraClientMonitor instance is now created per cluster to make JMX integration with multi-cluster setups much easier. (https://github.com/rantav/hector/issues/issue/137)

CassandraHostRetry service will retry downed hosts in a background thread at the interval specified on CassandraHostConfigurator (on by default at 30sec interval)
Refactoring of the connection pooling innards to fix epic race condition on failover. This includes but is not limited to:
- Removal of classes effectively matching the pattern CassandraClient* from the service package
- Command is gone. It was no longer needed and was more confusing than anything else
- Pooling logic has been stress tested by a neutral third party (no, really!)
Upgrade to thrift 0.5 to match Cassandra (it caught us by surprise as well). 
The system_rename_* methods were removed matching removal of such in Thrift API
Microsecond level granularity is now the default
NodeAutoDiscoverService will periodically look for new hosts on the ring and add them (off by default)

 batchMutate doesn't work with null predicate in deletion. Cannot batch-delete rows.
 getSuperColumn() does not return null
 KeyspaceImpl.getSuperColumn() should use cassandra.get() and not cassandra.get_slice()

Remove some unused meta calls from CassandraClient, such as getConfigFile and getStringProperty
